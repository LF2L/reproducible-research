```



# Instructions

The main goal of this template is to explore most of the possibilities that we can do with RMarkdown.
The main idea is to copy page the fragments of that are highlighted.
Copy each one at the time, compile every time the document with the button `Knit` to see what happens.


So let's go on:



# Exploring the potentialities

## YAML Section
The YAML section is the text that you find between the `---` in the document.

***

The initial options are:

```yaml
---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
output: html_document
---
```
This gives the *Title* of the document, and the type of document as a results is a site web `Html`.


***


Now, let's put **Date**, and the compile with `Knit` button:

```yaml
---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
date: "May 1, 2015"
author:
  - Student 1
  - Student 2
  - Student 3
output: html_document
---
```

***


Put the **Authors** of the document:

```yaml
---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
author:
  - Student 1
  - Student 2
  - Student 3
output: html_document
---
```
Now, given this initial `YAML` introduction,
we'll write in `Markdown` style.

***

## Writing in Markdown

The first element is write the titles:
Put these elemnts in your document

```markdown
# This is a title
## Sub-Title
### Subsub-Title
#### Sub.... Title
##### Sub.......Title
###### Sub.........Title
```

So, put the `YMLA` section **And** the **Title as follows:


```yaml
---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
date: "May 1, 2015"
author:
  - Student 1
  - Student 2
  - Student 3
output: html_document
---

# This is a title
## Sub-Title
### Subsub-Title
#### Sub.... Title
##### Sub.......Title
###### Sub.........Title
```

***

Here we can add some types of text for each title.

```markdown
### Emphasis

- Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

- Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

- Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

- Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

```
***
Here we can have *lists*:

```markdown
### Lists

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

```

***
*Links*:

```markdown

**These are inline Links:**

- [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

- [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

**References links:**

- [I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

- [I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

- [You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

- Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].


[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

```
***
*Images*:

```markdown

**Inline-style:** 
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

**Reference-style:** 
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"

```



***

*Tables*:

```markdown

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

```
You can generate tables using the [Markdown generato](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).

***

 And some especial elements to highligth some code:
 
```markdown
**Inline** --> `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```
 
Or to do blockquotes

```markdown
> This is a Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.
```

***

Let's explore now,  some additional elements to the `Html` documents. We'll put a Table of content `toc`:

```yaml
---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
date: "May 1, 2015"
author:
  - Student 1
  - Student 2
  - Student 3
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
---
````

**Attention to the indentation when you put the `html` options.

***

Include the number section:

```yaml
---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
date: "May 1, 2015"
author:
  - Student 1
  - Student 2
  - Student 3
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true    
    number_sections: true
---
````

We can include some `themes`to change the aspects: 

---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
date: "May 1, 2015"
author:
  - Student 1
  - Student 2
  - Student 3
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true    
    number_sections: true
    toc_float: true    
    number_sections: true
    theme: united
    highligth: tango
---

[You can see some styles in this link](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#appearance-and-style)


***

## Different Outputs

Ok, once we have some text in the document, we can explore the different `Outputs` that we can obtain.

There are two mainly

- **Documents**
- **Presentations**

We'll produce the `Html` and a `pdf document`

You can see that the `#` is used to 'comment' the lines concerning the `Html`


```yaml
---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
date: "May 1, 2015"
author:
  - Student 1
  - Student 2
  - Student 3
#output: 
#  html_document:
#    toc: true
#    toc_float: true    
#    number_sections: true
#    theme: united
#    highligth: tango
output: pdf_document
---
```

**Attention: It`s possible that inline figures do not work because you need the `.jpg` on the folder ---> 

***

Or you can made `word` documents.

```yaml
---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
date: "May 1, 2015"
author:
  - Student 1
  - Student 2
  - Student 3
#output: 
#  html_document:
#    toc: true
#    toc_float: true    
#    number_sections: true
#    theme: united
#    highligth: tango
output: word_document
---
```


***

Concerning presentations, you can create presentations as follow:

```yaml
---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
date: "May 1, 2015"
author:
  - Student 1
  - Student 2
  - Student 3
#output: 
#  html_document:
#    toc: true
#    toc_float: true    
#    number_sections: true
#    theme: united
#    highligth: tango
#output: word_document

```{r, cars, fig.cap="A scatterplot.", echo=FALSE}
