# Instructions

The main goal of this template is to explore most of the possibilities that we can do with RMarkdown.

The main idea is to copy page the fragments of that are between each horizontal line `---`.
Each type that you copy and page on your own script, you with compile every time that  the document with the button `Knit`.

So let's go on:



# Exploring type of data

## Initial configuration

Create a new `.Rmd` documents using a the following `YAML` configuration, changing the names.

```yaml
---
title: "First Reproducible Document"
date: "May 1, 2015"
author:
  - Student 1
  - Student 2
  - Student 3
output: html_document
---
```

## Chunks

In `Rmd`, there are two types of elements

- The text (markdown) that will appear in the document.
- the `chunks` that will do some calculations.

Write the following elements

## R code

There are two types of R code in R Markdown/**knitr** documents: 

- R code chunks ---> `` ``r ''`{r }` `` 

- and inline R code ---> `` ``r ''`r R_CODE` ``

The chunk is put it beteew
The inline can be embedded inline with other document elements. 

R code chunks look like plain code blocks, but have `{r}` after the three backticks and (optionally) chunk options inside `{}`.

Run the following chunk:

````markdown
`r ''````{r chunk-label, echo = FALSE}
1 + 1
```
````

So here we have three main elements

- `{r` ---> means that is a place of code using `R` Language

- `chunk-label` ---> it is the name of that particular chunk

- `echo = FALSE` ---> They are chunk options 

***

Now, run the same chunk with the option `echo = TRUE`

````markdown
`r ''````{r chunk-label, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = 'A figure caption.'}
1 + 1
```
````

- *Did you see the difference?*

Using the same chunk, let's change `include = FALSE` 

````markdown
`r ''````{r chunk-label, echo = TRUE, include = FALSE}
1 + 1
```
````


Then, `include = TRUE` 

````markdown
`r ''````{r chunk-label, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
1 + 1
```
````

If a certain option needs to be frequently set to a value in multiple code chunks, you can consider setting it globally in the first code chunk of your document, e.g.,

````markdown
`r ''````{r, configuration, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = TRUE)
```
````




***

Let's use inline elements:

We define the value `x=5`.

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
x = 5  # radius of a circle
```
````


Then we can put:  

```markdown
For a circle with the radius `` ``r ''`r x` ``, its area is `` ``r ''`r pi * x^2` ``.
```

***

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
x = 5  # radius of a circle
```
````

## Figures

You can provide a figure caption using `fig.cap` in the chunk options. If the document output format supports the option `fig_caption: true` (e.g., the output format `rmarkdown::html_document`), the R plots will be placed into figure environments. In the case of PDF output, such figures will be automatically numbered. 


To place multiple figures side-by-side from the same code chunk, you can use the `fig.show='hold'` option along with the `out.width` option. Figure \@ref(fig:hold-position) shows an example with two plots, each with a width of `50%`.

```{r hold-position, fig.cap='Two plots side-by-side.', fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19)
plot(pressure, pch = 17)
```

If you want to include a graphic that is not generated from R code, you may use the `knitr::include_graphics()` function, which gives you more control over the attributes of the image than the Markdown syntax of `![alt text or image title](path/to/image)` (e.g., you can specify the image width via `out.width`). Figure \@ref(fig:include-graphics) provides an example of this.

````markdown
`r ''````{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='...'}
knitr::include_graphics('Name-of-image.jpg')
```
````



### Tables

The easiest way to include tables\index{tables} is by using `knitr::kable()`, which can create tables for HTML, PDF and Word outputs.^[You may also consider the **pander** package. There are several other packages for producing tables, including **xtable**, **Hmisc**, and **stargazer**, but these are generally less compatible with multiple output formats.] Table captions can be included by passing `caption` to the function, e.g.,

````markdown
`r ''````{r tables-mtcars}
knitr::kable(iris[1:5, ], caption = 'A caption')
```
````
