A key part of [Pokémon Go](http://www.Pokémongo.com/) is using evolutions to 
get stronger Pokémon, and a deeper understanding of evolutions is key to being 
the greatest Pokémon Go player of all time. The data set you will be working 
with for this assignment covers 75 Pokémon evolutions spread across four 
species. A wide set of variables are provided, allowing a deeper dive into what 
characteristics are important in predicting a Pokémon's final combat power (CP).

## Data

[The dataset for this assignment can be found as a csv file at here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LF2L/reproducible-research/gh-pages/assets/data/pokemon.csv). 
Save the data as `Pokemon.csv`.

The variable 
descriptions are as follows:

- `name`: A unique name given to the Pokémon
- `species`: The Pokémon's type, e.g. Pidgey.
- `cp`: Pre-evolution Combat Power, which is a summary of the Pokémon's strength 
for battling prior to the evolution of the Pokémon.
- `hp`: Pre-evolution Hit Points, which is a summary of how difficult it is to 
weaken the Pokémon in a battle.
- `weight`: Pre-evolution weight, in kilograms.
- `height`: Pre-evolution height, in meters.
- `power_up_stardust`: Pre-evolution stardust required to power up the Pokémon.
- `power_up_candy`: Pre-evolution candy required to power up the Pokémon.
- `attack_weak`: The name of the pre-evolution weaker attack of the Pokémon.
- `attack_weak_type`: The type of the pre-evolution weaker attack.
- `attack_weak_value`: The damage done by the pre-evolution weaker attack.
- `attack_strong`: The name of the pre-evolution stronger attack.
- `attack_strong_type`: The type of the pre-evolution stronger attack.
- `attack_strong_value`: The damage done by the pre-evolution stronger attack.
- `cp_new`: Post-evolution Combat Power.
- `hp_new`: Post-evolution Hit Points.
- `weight_new`: Post-evolution weight, in kilograms.
- `height_new`: Post-evolution height, in meters.
- `power_up_stardust_new`: Post-evolution stardust required to power up the 
Pokémon.
- `power_up_candy_new`: Post-evolution candy required to power up the Pokémon.
- `attack_weak_new`: The name of the post-evolution weaker attack.
- `attack_weak_type_new`: The type of the post-evolution weaker attack.
- `attack_weak_value_new`: The damage done by the post-evolution weaker attack.
- `attack_strong_new`: The name of the post-evolution stronger attack.
- `attack_strong_type_new`: The type of the post-evolution stronger attack.
- `attack_strong_value_new`: The damage done by the post-evolution stronger 
attack.
- `notes`: Any additional notes made while collecting the data.

## Exercises

- First element to do in data analysis is to `setup`  the libraries that we need

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)

```
````



- Here the code for reading the data
````markdown
`r ''````{r Data, echo = FALSE}
Pokemon = read_csv("Pokemon.csv") # Reading the data
```
````

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Pokemon = read_csv("data/Pokemon.csv") # Reading the data
```

- Calculate the difference in heights pre and post evolution and save this as a 
new variable.

- Calculate the percentage of Pokémon that grew during evolution. 

- Here are the mean values of weigth and heith Pre-evolution. What are the mean value of for Post-Evolution?

```{r tables-mtcars}
Pre = Pokemon %>% group_by(species) %>% summarise(Mean.weight = mean(weight), 
                                                      Mean.height = mean(weight)) 
knitr::kable(Pre, caption = 'A caption')
```


- Also visualize the distribution of change in height by species and provide a 
discussion of how change in height varies across species.
**Create an histogram)**



```{r}

Pokemon = Pokemon %>% mutate(diferencias =  c(height_new - height))
Pokemon = Pokemon %>% mutate(Percentage =  (diferencias / height )*100 )

```


---



-  Can you recreate the following plot?:

```{r}

Pokemon %>% 
  filter(species != "Weedle") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, fill = attack_weak)) + 
    geom_bar(position="dodge") + 
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "Species", y = "Frequency", fill = "Attack weak",
         title = "Pre-evolution weaker attack of the Pokémon",
         subtitle = "by species") +
    theme_minimal()


```


- Pick a numerical and a categorical variable, and construct side-by-side box 
plots depicting the relationship between them.

```{r}
ggplot(Pokemon, aes(x = species, y=weight, fill = attack_weak)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal()

```



- Could you imagine another visualization?
