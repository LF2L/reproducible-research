**First document to do**

Improve these visualizations using RStudio based on the tutorials that you watched, answer the following questions using the document created in the [getting started](/workshop-1/):

You should produce one visualization per dataset. 
Your visualization should be accompanied by a brief paragraph describing the choice you made in your improvement, specifically discussing what you didn't like in the original plots and why, and how you addressed them in the visualization you created.

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations collects data on fisheries 
production of countries. [This Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry_by_country) 
lists fishery production of countries for 2005. For each country tonnage from 
capture and aquaculture are listed. Note that countries which harvested less 
than 100,000 tons are not included in the data. The source data can be found 
in the `fisheries` dataset in the **dsbox** package. The following plots were 
produced based on the data given on the Wikipedia page.
