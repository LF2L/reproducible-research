### Rmarkdown

- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning
- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

**First document to do**

Based on the tutorials that you watched, answer the following questions using the document created in the [getting started](/workshop-1/):

Given below are two data visualizations that violate many data visualization best practices. 
Improve these visualizations using R and the tips for effective visualizations that we introduced in class. You should produce one visualization per dataset. 
Your visualizaiton should be accompanies by a brief paragraph describing the choices you made in your improvement, specifically discussing what you didn't like in the original plots and why, and how you addressed them in the visualization you created.

On the due date you will give a brief presentation describing one of your improved visualizations and the reasoning for the choices you made.

## Exercises

-. **Fisheries**: Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations collects data on fisheries 
production of countries. [This Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry_by_country) 
lists fishery production of countries for 2005. For each country tonnage from 
capture and aquaculture are listed. Note that countries which harvested less 
than 100,000 tons are not included in the data. The source data can be found 
in the `fisheries` dataset in the **dsbox** package. The following plots were 
produced based off the data given on the Wikipedia page.

-. **Instructional staff employee trends**: The American Association of 
University Professors (AAUP) is a nonprofit membership association of faculty 
and other academic professionals. 

[This report](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP_Report_InstrStaff-75-11_apr2013.pdf) 
compiled by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 and 2011.

The following plots were produced based off the data given on the Wikipedia page.
