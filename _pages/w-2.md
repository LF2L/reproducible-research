## R Basics

### What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)
- At its simplest:<sup>➥</sup>
    - R is like a car’s engine
    - RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

### Rmarkdown

- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning
- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

## Basic functions

### Function syntax

A short list (for now):

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parantheses:



```markdown
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```


### Install packages
