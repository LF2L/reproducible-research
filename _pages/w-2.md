## R Basics

### Rmarkdown

- Simple markdown syntax for text
- Fully reproducible reports -- each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning

- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks





### What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)
- At its simplest:<sup>➥</sup>
    - R is like a car’s engine
    - RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/engine-dashboard.png")
```
