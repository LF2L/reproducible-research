# Main goal

- Understand the importance of *replication principle* of the research
- Create a dynamic document



---
## Music and Research




---
## Replication Vs. Reproducibility


- **Replication** focuses on the validity of the scientific claim.
- "Is this claim true?"

- Important for policymakers and regulatory decisions

---

## Replication Vs. Reproducibility

- **Reproducibility**  refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original researcher (Goodman, Fanelli, and Ioannidis 2016).

- Focuses on the validity of the data analysis --- *"Can we trust this analysis?"*


---
## Replication Vs. Reproducibility

 Two key principles: 
 - Literate programming for enabling reproducibilty
 - Version control for enhancing transparency


---
## Literate programming for enabling reproducibilty

*Literate programming refers to the use of a computing environment for authoring documents that contain a mix of natural (eg. English) and computer (eg. R) languages (Schulte et al. 2012)*

# Summary

- Reproducible research is important as a **minimum standard**, partcularly for studies that are difficult to replicate
- Infrastructure is needed for creating and distributing reproducible documents, beyond what is currently available
- There is a growing number of tools for creating reproducible documents
