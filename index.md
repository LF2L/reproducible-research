## Description

One of the main principles of the scientific research is related to its reproducible quality.
Reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original researcher (Goodman, Fanelli, and Ioannidis 2016). This is a cornerstone of the sciences because if we cannot reproduce previous studies, we cannot rely on their results, and we cannot build on them to generate new knowledge

Why is *reproducibility* gaining attention? Four factors have lead to growing concerns about the reproducibility of scientific results in modern science. 

- The first factor is reruns of landmark biomedical experiments that have failed to produce the same results as the initial publication of the experiment (Prinz, Schlange, and Asadullah 2011; Begley and Ellis 2012). 
- The second factor is the discovery of high-profile studies where the published results were flawed due to simple errors data analysis(Baggerly and Coombes 2009; Herndon, Ash, and Pollin 2013). 
- Third, there has been a sharp rise in the number of scholarly publications that have been retracted due to discoveries of misconduct such as fraudulent data and plagiarism (Van Noorden 2011; Steen 2013). 
- Finally, there has been a growth of data-intensive research that use massive computer simulations or collect enourmous amounts of data from vast numbers of sensors (ie. astronomy and oceanography).
