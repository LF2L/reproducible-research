      "contents": "\nDescription\nOne of the main principles of scientific research is related to its reproducible quality. Reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials that were used by the original researcher (Goodman, Fanelli, and Ioannidis 2016). This is a cornerstone of scientific research because if we cannot reproduce previous studies, we cannot rely on their results, and we cannot build on them to generate new knowledge.\nWhy is reproducibility gaining attention? Four factors have lead to growing concerns about the reproducibility of scientific results in modern science.\nThe first factor is reruns of landmark biomedical experiments that have failed to produce the same results as the initial publication of the experiment (Prinz, Schlange, and Asadullah 2011; Begley and Ellis 2012).\nThe second factor is the discovery of high-profile studies where the published results were flawed due to simple errors data analysis (Baggerly and Coombes 2009; Herndon, Ash, and Pollin 2013).\nThird, there has been a sharp rise in the number of scholarly publications that have been retracted due to discoveries of misconduct such as fraudulent data and plagiarism (Van Noorden 2011; Steen 2013).\nFinally, there has been a growth of data-intensive research that use massive computer simulations or collect enourmous amounts of data from vast numbers of sensors (ie. astronomy and oceanography).\nGoal\n{% capture notice-text %} - [X] Understand the importance of the replication principle in research - [X] Create a first reproducible article {% endcapture %}\n\nGoal of this course:\n{{ notice-text | markdownify }}\n\nBibliography\nGoodman, Steven N., Daniele Fanelli, and John P.
